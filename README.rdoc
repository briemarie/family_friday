Welcome to FamilyFriday!

Please clone this repo to get started.

To run the app in localhost, ensure that you have ruby (minimum version 2.1.5)
and rails (minimum version 4.2.3) installed,
and install all needed dependencies found in the Gemfile.
This can be done by running `bundle install` from within the cloned directory.

After installation is complete, ensure that the database is set up by running
